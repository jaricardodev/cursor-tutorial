# Lumenalta To-Do MVP — Workspace Rules (always on in this folder)


Context: Build a tiny To-Do app for onboarding (React + TypeScript, Vite). No backend.
Role: Act as a senior frontend pair—write code in small, safe diffs and explain briefly.
Action: Implement MVP features and light UI polish; ask before running terminal commands.
Format: Show short diffs and the exact command(s) you intend to run; wait for approval.
Tone: Professional, clear, minimal; avoid file-path jargon unless I ask.


Examples: New task appears on top; a checkbox toggles completed; filters show counts.


Definition of Done (Constraints):
- Add / Toggle / Delete work
- localStorage persists after refresh
- Filters: All / Active / Completed with counts
- Clean, centered layout; readable contrast
- `npm run dev` runs with no errors


Additional Constraints:
- Use a small typed `Task` (id, title, completed, createdAt ms) + `createTask` helper
  (use `crypto.randomUUID()` when available; trim the title).
- Keep components small; avoid heavy state libraries.
- Name things `TaskInput`, `TaskItem`, etc.
- Ask before terminal actions; prefer minimal diffs.
